- VPSC constraint-based overlap removal
- Auto-spread connected nodes for readable layouts

**Shapes**
- Shape tool with rectangle, ellipse, diamond, and more
- Shape hover bar for quick actions (hidden for non-basic shapes)
- Drag-time collision detection

**Commands**
- `Anytime Graph: New Graph` to create a new graph file

### Graph Core (graph-core)
- 10 node types (rect, ellipse, diamond, parallelogram, cylinder, sticky, text, doc, frame, image)
- 3 edge types (line, arrow, connector) + orthogonal connectors (A* obstacle avoidance) + Bezier curves
- Smart guides, grid snap, node alignment and distribution
- Viewport (pan, zoom 0.1-10x, fit-to-content)
- Undo/Redo (selection state preservation, max 50 history entries)
- SVG export, draw.io XML export/import
