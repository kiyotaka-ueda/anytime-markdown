- Reduce connector start dot radius from 5 to 3
- Break circular dependency between `shapes` and `shapeRenderers`

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-12

### Graph Core (graph-core)

- Auto-spread connected nodes for readable layouts

**Shapes**
- Shape tool with rectangle, ellipse, diamond, and more
- Shape hover bar for quick actions (hidden for non-basic shapes)
