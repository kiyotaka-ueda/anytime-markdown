**Rich preview of AI-generated Markdown while you code — all inside VS Code.**

AI assistants write specs, designs, and notes in Markdown, but reviewing plain text is hard to read and switching between tools breaks your flow.

Anytime Markdown gives you a WYSIWYG editor with rich rendering, plus **collaborative editing with AI** to prevent file conflicts.

## 1. What You Can Do

- **Rich Markdown editing** — render tables, Mermaid, PlantUML, and KaTeX inline
- **Auto-lock while AI is editing** — prevent conflicts when Claude Code is writing to a file
- **AI change highlight in gutter** — visually mark edited blocks in the gutter when Claude Code modifies the file
- **Switch between 3 modes with one click** — WYSIWYG, Source, Review


## 2. Getting Started

Right-click a `.md` / `.markdown` file and choose **"Open with Anytime Markdown"** to open it in the editor.

Available from both the Explorer context menu and the editor title bar context menu.


## 3. Auto-Lock While AI Is Editing (Claude Code Collaborative Editing)

While Claude Code is editing a file, the editor becomes read-only to prevent conflicts.\
When editing finishes, the lock is released and the content is updated automatically.

- **[Anytime Trail](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=anytime-trial.anytime-trail) required** — Trail registers the Claude Code hooks; this extension reads the status to control locking
- **Handles rapid edits** — lock is released 3 seconds after the last edit
- **Crash safe** — auto-unlocks after 30 seconds if Claude Code stops responding


## 4. AI Change Highlight Review

When Claude Code edits a file and the editor auto-reloads, changed and added blocks are marked in the gutter on the left side of the editor.\
See at a glance what was rewritten, then press `Escape` to clear the markers.

- **Added / changed blocks** — change marker shown in gutter
- **Deleted sections** — deletion indicator shown at the position of removal
- **Only active when auto-reload is enabled**


## 5. Editor Modes

| Mode | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| **WYSIWYG** | Visual editing with formatting, diagrams, and tables |
